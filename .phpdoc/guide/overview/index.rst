Overview
########

The package currently contains classes for :doc:`datastructures`, :doc:`errorhandlers`, multiple :doc:`interfaces`, and
more generic :doc:`traits` for common use cases. They share the same design principles like property and method naming
schema, the highest coding standards of `PHPStan <https://phpstan.org/>`_ and `Psalm <https://psalm.dev/>`_, and full
`PSR-12 <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/>`_ compliance to make sure they can be combined and easily re-used in
other projects.
